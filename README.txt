### Using Clustering Analysis to classify Baseball players
Files include datasets of player stats collected from Baseball-reference.com
MLB_All.py will use the dataset and perform Principle Component Analysis (PCA) on the datasets. This will then display a graph of players. It will also output csv files that have player names and PCA values.
MLB_Pitchers and MLB_Batters will then use the files created from MLB_All.py to rank the Baseball players from best to worst. It will then output a csv file to be viewed.
